CS426 Assignment 2 "Computer Architecture and Cats"
Bianca Jankiewicz, Ethan Ng, and Xavier Skinner

Our game is an educational binary conversions game. The players are presented with a randomly generated decimal number and must convert it to binary to destroy the boss. Our less common procedure is that in order to defeat the boss, both players are required. 
Less common procedure/rule: in order to complete the game you need both players. Each player is assigned a 0 or 1 and must shoot in the order of the binary converted number to defeat the boss. This is also the multiplayer aspect. To follow the Computer Architecture and Cats theme, the gameplay is computer architecture related and the cats are the UI elements. 

The objective is for users to practice their binary conversions with a friend and the question we ask at the end is: Convert the number 13 to binary. Answer: 1101
